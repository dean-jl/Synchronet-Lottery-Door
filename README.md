# Synchronet-Lottery-Door
 Synchronet BBS Lottery Door by Dean Lodzinski

This code is for the Lottery door I wrote circa 1994 for Synchronet BBS.
I just found this on an old floppy disk in February 2020.  I'm making this available
for anyone that may find it useful.  I am not/was not a developer.  I am sure this code
won't win any prizes.  Provided as-is.

I was using Borland C++ for DOS version 3.x I believe.

This also requires the Synchronet BBS xsdk.h header file.
